Growing up in the '00s and '10s taught me a totally irrational view of technology. I learned to view any piece of tech, large or small, as a snapshot of a trajectory under constant acceleration. Take a machine, and anything measurable - speed, power efficiency, even beauty - would all improve exponentially with each successive generation. This has been the default for as long as I've been aware of tech, but it's hard to blame anyone for thinking this way. Moore's Law predicts that the density of transistors on a computer chip will double every two years. I'm in my early 20s, and it's been more or less right for my entire life, and a few decades before. I had to rethink this when, a few weeks ago, I saw an Apache helicopter. 

The Apache is a beautiful machine. A sloped brow thickens vertically into an oblong thorax, flanked by narrow horizontal fins. The thorax tapers to a lithe tail long again as its body capped by a triangular fin. In flight, viewed from behind, its rotors are nearly invisible, existing mostly as a mental footnote to explain the technical wonder in progress. Look at a hawk for a moment and its flight is immediately legible as such. The Apache's insectine body moves through the air in an entirely different way, pitching and yawing about its center impossibly fast, as if unbound by the same laws that lift the hawk and carry it smoothly across a current. Its form has been more or less unchanged since 1975. Like the crocodile, unevolved since the meteor strike that wiped out the dinosaurs, it's a perfect predator. 

I had never thought that we could have created a machine so beautiful and functional back then, let alone one that was still competitive in today's marketplace of ideas. How could anything survive half a century of yearly doubling?

Earth, being a finite place, rarely hosts systems that grow exponentially. On a long enough timescale, almost everything here that looks exponential turns out to be logistic. A logistic curve starts at zero, and rises with an acceleration that suggests exponential growth. Then, suddenly, its growth rate slows precipitously and the curve flattens under a horizontal asymptote. The logistic curve describes the dynamics of almost every living population we've observed long enough in a habitat with a finite carrying capacity. A computer chip isn't a habitat, but we're starting to see the level-off, and unless you buy into wishful forecasts about quantum computing, we have a finite number of doubling events left. 

Lately, of course, listening to tech hope-timism has been a recipe for disappointment. How many revolutionary innovations have ended up being vaporware? Peter Thiel famously lamented that we "were promised flying cars, but we got 140 characters." Thiel and others like him turn this truth into a blame game, pointing the finger at their political heels like new hiring practices and "green" public investment standards. But maybe we were wrong to look at the rate of tech development in the 1990s and expect flying cars at all. 

At the right cut-off point, the first-order approximation of a logistic curve looks like the "hockey stick" chart that gets investors out of bed in the morning. Investors love technology companies; in fact, I hope I find someone who loves me as much as investors love Uber - someone who'll stick with me through thick and thin, who'll say I'm worth billions to her whether I'm lighting $400 million on fire in a quarter or I'm just plain revenue neutral. 

The tech sector trades at one and a half times higher relative price-to-earnings ratio than the rest of the stock market. The only way I can think to explain this is that investors have bought into the same Moore's Law mindset that I did, and they're waiting for the line to go vertical. But even in reality, the hyper-growth some tech companies enjoy is barely connected to returns. Moore Mindset was a bit of a hoodwink - the things that make a business profitable are mostly the same as they were before apps. Many tech innovations have actually been social and legal innovations that made the human labor that powers them more obscured, more precarious and less dignified.

The best expression of the mismatch here has been the large language model hype cycle. Their scaling laws require ever-increasing amounts of computational resources and human labeling work to drive linear performance improvements. We're so past the point of diminishing returns that tech companies are starting to build datacenters with on-site nuclear power plants to meet some of their astronomical demand. Perhaps, not unlike the Apache, information processing is close to maturity. It would certainly appear so from the increasingly speculative venture-funded, hype-based tech ideas that dominated the tech atmosphere in the last four years. Advances in computer hardware and telecommunications from the 1950s to the 1990s created a fertile "business habitat", and IT may be reaching the top of its logistic curve. 

This is all unfolding at a time when the real world could use a lot more attention. Making our finely-tuned global logistics system that keeps stuff cheap and people happy robust to disruptions  

But private capital is less interested in that stuff, because it isn't going to double every year forever. 



We understand perfectly well that other living systems are constrained in their growth. But we have a bit of a blind spot when it comes to ourselves and the machines we build. It's partially because we've never been near global carrying capacity, and so never confronted our own asymptote. But look at the trends in crop productivity and you'll understand that our current food system only has so much room to grow - it too is constrained by finite space and competition with the ever-growing human population. There's little convincing evidence for the scalability of new agricultural technologies like hydroponics and vertical farming, so there's no reason to believe the magical thinking that some innovation will come and save us at the last minute. Of course, short-term exponential returns can still happen on a logistic planet. But just like one bacterial population overtaking another in a petri dish, the returns are zero-sum. The total biomass on the dish is constrained.

Logistic growth explains much of the incoherence in our current moment. Our cultural, social and technocratic institutions, which together comprise what I call the "symbolic world", have all tied themselves into the same network and legitimize one another self-referentially. A successful existence in the bubble they circumscribe - investment in a home paying off, or individual retirement, for instance - is essentially predicated on perpetual growth at an increasing rate. The entire symbolic economy rests on mathematical models that are calibrated to expect the entire stock market to return 8-10% each year. As the impossibility of such growth becomes clear, the messages coming out of the symbolic world become more and more obviously incoherent.  

While we were on the first half of the curve, the mismatch was easier to ignore. But it's becoming increasingly clear that a different model, one where firms act on behalf of the state and marked by more explicit state control and a public-private oligarchy, is winning out, even according to the arbitrary metrics the symbolic world defines. China is ten years ahead of the American electric vehicle industry, and all signs point to the US government ramping up protectionism. Ironic - the inventors of globalism are gearing up for a total reversal once it no longer benefits our firms. At the very least, it'll be interesting to see how our superstructure responds to these new competitive pressures. One can only hope that they will meet the moment and understand that another epoch of growth will require more public investment into boring hard tech and infrastructure instead of buying into their own hype.
