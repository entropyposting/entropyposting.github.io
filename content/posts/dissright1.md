Nobody really remembers pro-Soviet novelists from the postwar era. Whatever you believe about the original project of the USSR, the governing structure had become so detached and fragile towards the end that it was impossible to make good art that started from the premise that that superstructure was tethered to reality.

I think we're entering a similar era in American art and posting now. I can't think of the last good piece of art that earnestly accepts the mainstream liberal worldview, because it too has become detached from reality. In its place we're inundated with tongue-in-cheek self-aware slop, because that's the only way most people can cope with this loss of innocence and consensus reality. This ironic entertainment is like zero-sugar candy; it blows out your taste buds but never sates you, never soothes you in the way that a earnest piece of art is capable of.

All this is to say that I'm on the the hunt for good, modern entertainment media. And, to be clear, EVERYTHING in this whole mediaplex – the New York Times front to back, the dissident email newsletters, the podcasts and the Verso books and the video essays and the livestreams – is entertainment media and nothing more.

I've had some success that I'll talk about another time, but I've found myself perversely drawn to right wing weirdos.

It's pretty easy for me to become fascinated with some RW rando poster's body of work. I'll spend a week submerged in his substack diatribes and podcast appearances, playing pretend and inhabiting his reality tunnel, which almost never intersects with the one I normally live in. These alternate universes sometimes have a surprising degree of complexity (and, frankly, entertainment value), but ultimately I'm always disenchanted.

They draw you in with a well-reasoned critique. The first time you hear Curtis Yarvin argue that American representative democracy is really neither representative nor democratic (and back it up with nerdy white boy swag), you might be willing to hear him out that we might as well abolish the so-called deep state and just go full-bore public totalitarian. But once you listen to every clip of him out there, you realize that his only argument is the critique. He has no proposal for what to do with that power, besides "I want to keep living my life exactly as it is, but I want there to be less homeless people and I want my kids to get into good colleges". The entire dissident right is intellectually malnourished in this same way. They either promise nothing or promise to put the individual liberty genie back in the bottle in specific, extremely infeasible ways.

The only positive vision they offer is a new form of statehood better equipped to "do big things" for their own sake, an idea totally cribbed from 2000s-era startup guys. When you actually consider the absolute dearth of concrete ideas they have, they mostly boil down to "abolish constraints on private power and turn possession from 9/10 to 10/10 of the law". Sigh, boring. Wake me up when you want to make us wear robes and do cool monk shit.
